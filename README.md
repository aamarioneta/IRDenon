# IRDenon
Web Interface to remote control a Denon AVR with an ESP8266 and a infrared led or the Room to Room connection.

There are 4 ways to remote control older Denon AVR's (in my case Denon AVR 2308):
1. by remote: my AVR is inside a tv console and there is no line of sight.
2. by RS232: i managed to remote control it by connecting the COM Port of an old PC (which still has a COM port interface) and it worked perfectly. I just did not want another PC running. My first intention was to connect the ESP8266 Serial port to the Denon COM Port but I just could not get it working.
3. Infrared extender / blaster (you can get one for 10-15â‚¬) but what's the fun in that? This repo can be used for emitting IR signals through a IR led.
4. Using the "Room to Room" "REMOTE CONTROL" or whatever it's called. Some AVR have the possibility to control other devices in other rooms for example. This is just a jack input for the same signals as for the IR led. This repo can also be used for emitting IR signals through the jack input without the need of a IR led. See your Denon manual

## Installation
- Copy credentials.h.sample to credentials.h and edit the SSID and password for your WiFi.
- For controlling a IR led (3) connect the NPN transistor and IR led as described here:
https://github.com/crankyoldgit/IRremoteESP8266/wiki#ir-sending
- For controlling direct the "Room to Room" "REMOTE CONTROL": connect a 2 wire cable with a mono jack to ground and D2 on the ESP8266. You can also use a mono headphone cable or a stereo headphone cable (just connect the 2 channels together).

Upload the INO file to the ESP8266.

You can get the IP address of the ESP8266 from the serial output or from your router. I configured the router to always give the ESP8266 the same IP.

You can test the IR led by looking at it with any phone camera, or by replacing the IR led with a normal led. It should blink when you use the web interface.

Currently only the basic functions implemented, but other codes can easly be read with a IR receiver diode, see for example here: https://github.com/crankyoldgit/IRremoteESP8266/wiki#ir-receiving.
